    "Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past two lessons, you have learned what Unsupervised Machine Learning is, what problems are suitable for a solution based on Unsupervised Machine Learning, how to apply Unsupervised Machine Learning, and you have practiced implementing the basic phases of a solution using Scikit-learn. Now is time to put all that conceptual and procedural knowledge to work by doing a larger project. Choose a problem domain that motivates you, and build a complete solution implementing all the phases you learned about in previous chapters. We provide some ideas of interesting problem domains in a dedicated section in this lesson, but we want you to be creative and adventurous, and explore other options as well. This lesson does not present any new material: everything you will need to complete this project was discussed on previous lessons.\n",
    "External Interface Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input requirement: capacity to read a dataset stored on disk.\n",
    "    Output requirement: report on optimal number of clusters, centroid coordinates and quality metric.\n",
    "    Output requirement: identifiers of classes corresponding to new instances classified by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "    The software must learn a clusterization a the dataset.\n",
    "    The software must use the learned clusterization to classify new problem instances.\n",
    "    The software must evaluate the quality of a clusterization.\n",
    "    The software must be flexible to work with different preconfigured amount of clusters.\n",
    "    The software must compare results using different numbers of clusters and determine which number of clusters is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use Python as programming language.\n",
    "    Use Pandas for reading the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "    Use Scikit-learn for training and testing the Machine Learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Necessary Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python application that performs ETL, training, and testing.\n",
    "    Report containing quality metrics, and explanation of the dataset, and the experimental procedure (range of the different number of clusters that were tested, how the range was traversed, etc.).\n",
    "    Optional(Build a supervised model by attaching your labels(clusters) as Target)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions to Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "    Find an interesting dataset! Look in the Useful Resources section for sources of ideas.\n",
    "    If you do not find a pre-existing dataset on the problem domain that you like, be creative: consider building the dataset yourself and donating the dataset to one of the public Machine Learning repositories.\n",
    "    Break down the project into smaller tasks, for instance: importing the dataset, training, etc.\n",
    "    Decide whether you will create a single Python application or several Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Project Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "    Segment smartphone users according to phone usage and apps installed.\n",
    "    Segment healthy person under 50 years of age according to their risk or propensity of suffering from Alzheimer's disease after 70 years of age.\n",
    "    Classify differnent customers from an Ecomerce data.\n"
